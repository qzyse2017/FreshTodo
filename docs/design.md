# Design

## Goal
- suppose the user want to focus just simple and neat items when they are working, after all, TODO items are not the key of their work, their work itself is.
- Items should be quickly and easily to sort and clean. After all, this app is made just to make its fresher to manage various TODO items.
- It should be easy to backup, export as readable format(markdown? html?), sync within different source.
- The user may evaluate how much of work they have done
- Every items can be split into some more one, so may design two mode, List with List node Table mode and tree mode. The first one can perform fast and second one can manage a more projects composed of some smaller one.
